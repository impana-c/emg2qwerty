/home/bkwan27/anaconda3/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:315: PossibleUserWarning: Using `DistributedSampler` with the dataloaders. During `trainer.test()`, it is recommended to use `Trainer(devices=1, num_nodes=1)` to ensure each sample/batch gets evaluated exactly once. Otherwise, multi-device settings use `DistributedSampler` that replicates some samples to make sure all devices have same batch size in case of uneven inputs.
